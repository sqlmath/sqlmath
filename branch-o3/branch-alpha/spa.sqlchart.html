So I d like the Real Time group to sell the unit at the best price in the hourly market. I ve already bought gas for Friday and Saturday operations. I expect Sunday to be weak to not run the unit on Sunday. I would expect to be back in the market on  Monday. To sell the unit buy a BPA wheel using the accounts on the scheduling sheet. The variable price at the bottom is actual breakeven price. To start the unit call PGE at the control room number and give them an hour to get the unit online before you sell. It takes 46 minutes to get the unit from cold start to full load and online.Also, I ve bought reserves from BPA to make these schedules firm for the hour. I ll be out this afternoon and tomorrow and Stan will be standing in for me. I ll be available on my cell phone for any questions.Les'),

So I d like the Real Time group to sell the unit at the best price in the hourly market. I ve already bought gas for Friday and Saturday operations. I expect Sunday to be weak to not run the unit on Sunday. I would expect to be back in the market on  Monday. To sell the unit buy a BPA wheel using the accounts on the scheduling sheet. The variable price at the bottom is actual breakeven price. To start the unit call PGE at the control room number and give them an hour to get the unit online before you sell. It takes 46 minutes to get the unit from cold start to full load and online.Also, I ve bought reserves from BPA to make these schedules firm for the hour. I ll be out this afternoon and tomorrow and Stan will be standing in for me. I ll be available on my cell phone for any questions.Les'),

I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect. Let s do our best to continue to provide them with good service.Thanks,Bill-----Original Message-----From: tsoto/EPEC@epelectric.com [mailto:tsoto/EPEC@epelectric.com]Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 8:43 AMTo: Williams III, BillCc: hpuente/EPEC@epelectric.com; PowerMarketingFolks@epelectric.com;kpeterso@epelectric.comSubject: DISPLACING GAS-FIRED GENERATION Bill,  thanks for the visit we enjoyed it.  It is always helpful to talkface to face and have some frank discussion regarding   our currentbusiness relationship.  Hopefully, we ll be able to reciprocate with avisit in the near future.On a different matter, I was going over some recent historical data andhave come across some instances where I believe we have room to displacegas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power.  In order to dothis, we need to tighten up our real-time operations.  By this, I mean tostart putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums andreplacing it with purchased power (this would apply to the early morninghours only, since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn somebase gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and ourloss will be less).For example,  Thursday October 18, the unit commitment called for purchasesof around 330 MW during the early hours (see attached unit commitment foramounts and times).  We only purchased 130 MW net during this time frame.So we ended up generating around 200 mwh at around $44/mwh when purchasepower  was available for $19/mwh.  Furthermore, there was a sale for HE06:00 to ENRON/CAISO for $22/mwh.  When we enter this sale into our costingmodel, the sale will result in a loss of approximately $1,000 for EPE PowerMarketing since the model will use marginal cost (gas-fired generation) tocost this sale.Please look into this matter and  call me if you have any questions or wishto discuss it further.(See attached file: dispatch.xls)Tony SotoPower Marketing543-4181'),

    'UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses',
    'Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. Thank you for your support. Enron Global Technology   -----Original Message----- From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Cc: Subject: Supported Internet Email AddressesEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

    'FYI--The information below is an excellent overview of the procedures our administrative personnel will be using when handling and distributing your mail into mail folders.  However, all administrative personnel in the Portland Enron WTC offices have received a hard copy of the guidelines and procedures issued by Oregon Department Administrative Services.  This four-page document has detailed guidelines and instructions for mail/parcel handling.  If you would like to get a copy of these guidelines, ask your administrative assistant or you can contact Debra Davidson to get a copy.  The World Trade Center Mailroom has informed Debra that they are also screening mail for lumps, powdery substances, unusual written comments on envelopes, etc.  If they detect a suspicious piece of mail or package addressed to our office, they will notify us as well as the proper authorities.If you have any questions or concerns, please see me or Debra Davidson. -----Original Message-----From:  Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of John Brindle, Business Controls@ENRONSent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 7:42 PMTo: Enron Employees ---- Domestic@ENRONSubject: Anthrax and other Biological Agent ThreatsWe understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)--  It is marked with the word "Anthrax."--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential".--  Has a strange odor or stain.--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). -- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! --  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. --  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. --  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. --  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.'),

The congestion charges that have been= incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used= to calculate the charge. If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it i=s 137 MM based upon the ERCOT protocols. The actual cost to redispatch and =clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.

This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestio=n, rather a direct assignment of the charge. The charge may be partially of=fset by the TCR that will be auctioned. The PUCT has indicated an interest =to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of= a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management work=ing group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local= congestion issues when that trigger has been hit.  I will attach a copy of= the current draft of the TCR white paper.  In short, the TCR is a financia=l option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion.  There is= no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically =schedule to receive the benefit of the TCR.  There will be an auction on or= about the 4th of February, 2002 and the full zonal implementation will tak=e place February 15, 2002.

The Board had approve=d a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets, how=ever the plan has not been implemented.  The WMS discussed, at length, the =issue of simultaneously clearing all three markets - non-spinning, regulati=on, and responsive reserve.  A task force was formed to initially identify =the principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of a=ncillary services issue.  It was suggested that a consultant be hired to de=velop Protocol language once the principles are identified.  The first task= force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled. =20Demand-Side Task Force.  Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand-=Side Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load (BUL) Market Issues an=d other demand-side issues.  The PUCT expects the full functionality to be =in place on January 1, 2002.  The DSTF met last on October 1st (third meeti=ng).  The DSTF completed a draft status report on Demand-Side Resources and= Demand Responsiveness.  It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not comp=lete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board.  Howeve=r, ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report.  =The report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in= the demand side of ERCOT s market, reviews the PUCT s directive, reviews t=he role of demand-side resources in ERCOT s markets, and identifies the iss=ues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing.  It also summari=zes the options discussed by the DSTF to date.  The PUCT staff has suggeste=d that ERCOT hire a consultant, such as Eric Hirsch, to provide more resour=ces for this effort.  The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address d=irect load control issues at its next meeting.Unit Specific Deployments.  At the next WMS meeting October 24, 2001, there= will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will di=scuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the= ramp rates of the deployments.

(Legal)Subject: FW: article -----Original Message-----From:  Nelson, Kourtney  Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:22 AMTo: Blair, KitSubject: articleLawmakers examine relationship between state s grid and tradersBy JENNIFER COLEMAN11/13/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California grid officials said Tuesday they will stop providing state power buyers with aggregate price information that s not available to other participants in the state s energy market . Following a five-hour hearing of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market , officials with the California Independent System Operator said they would cut off that information as of midnight. The committee was examining the trading practices of the state power grid, which generators complained gave preferential treatment to the state s energy buyers with the California Department of Water Resources. Generators said the ISO, a state-created independent agency that was intended to ensure the smooth operation of the deregulated market , abandoned its independence when it agreed to give DWR additional market information. DWR has been buying power for three utilities since January when high wholesale prices brought the companies to the brink of bankruptcy. The ISO can only buy power to balance the grid if a "creditworthy" buyer backs the purchase. DWR stepped in to back those purchases. ISO officials said they gave DWR traders some information not otherwise available, but DWR requirements forced them to do it. In order to buy the cheapest energy for consumers, DWR required that ISO let it know how much energy will be needed in the next hour and approximate prices, so it could shop outside the grid for the best price, said Pete Garris, acting deputy director of DWR s trading arm. But that violated the ISO s tariffs and the Federal Power Act that require grid managers to treat all parties equally, said Robert Hayes of Mirant Inc. Though FERC has jurisdiction over the generators  complaint, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said he called the committee hearing on the same subject "to get a full understanding of what exactly has occurred." It s not the generator s only beef with the state s energy traders. Hayes said the ISO has also been bypassing bids for available power in order to buy out-of- market energy at higher prices. "There is substantial evidence that, at times, the ISO and DWR bypassed lower-cost power available in the real-time market in favor of higher, out-of- market power ," Hayes said. A majority of those out-of- market purchases were from the Canadian firm Power -Ex, which is the marketing arm of British Columbia Hydro, said Larry Drivon, an attorney for the committee. Last week, FERC intervened in another battle between generators and the state, ordering California to pay power suppliers $1.2 billion for energy sales to California since January. FERC said it would lift a key component of the commission s effort to stabilize California  s power market if the state does not quickly settle its bill with power generators. At issue is the "must-offer" requirement that prohibits generators from withholding power from the wholesale electricity market in a bid to drive up prices. FERC imposed it in April after months of soaring power prices and rolling blackouts in California  s deregulated electricity market . FERC said generators no longer will be required to do business with the ISO manager of much of the state s electric grid, if ISO does not arrange for prompt payment of past power sales. "The must-offer requirement assumes a matching must-pay requirement," commissioners said in their order. ISO has said it will comply with the order, under which the agency has 15 days to bill the DWR. California and federal energy officials said the "must-offer" requirement has played a big role in calming the state s previously unsettled energy market . "I give the must-offer requirement a lot of the credit for the current lower prices," FERC commissioner William Massey said in his dissent from parts of last week s order. But Massey agreed with the three other commissioners that something must be done to compel payment or risk a return to a "dysfunctional" market in California . ISO spokesman Greg Fishman said up to 13,000 megawatts of power a day have been out of service for maintenance in recent weeks, without any blackouts. Last spring, before FERC required generators to sell all their available power , similar outages resulted in blackouts, he said. "Today, because of the must-offer requirement, we ve been able to meet the demand," Fishman said.'),
